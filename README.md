"TEBD_Rydberg.py" uses infinite time evolving decimation (iTEBD) to calculate the evolution of local density, correlation function, and entanglement entropy in the nearest-neighbor blockade regime.

"Many_body_scar_ED.py" uses exact diagonalization to calculate the entanglement spectrum as well as overlap with the Z2 order.
